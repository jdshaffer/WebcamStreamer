# Webcam Streamer

This is an extremely simple, barebones, no frills webcam streamer.

It uses OpenCV to access the camera, and uses Flask for the web-server. (So, you will need to install those modules before it will run.)

**Use:**  `python3 webcam_streamer.py`

**Warning:** There is absolutely NO security in running this program. Anyone with your local IP can find this stream. So, be sure to use a firewall, and don't leave it running all the time!
